# Data Retention and Deletion Policy — Atomatic Android App

## Overview
Atomatic respects your privacy and ensures that your personal data is handled responsibly and transparently.  
This document describes how long user data is retained, what information is stored, and how you can request deletion of your data or account.

---

## Data Collected
Atomatic uses **Firebase Authentication** (by Google LLC) for user login.  
When you sign in using your **Google account** or a **username and password**, the following data may be stored in Firebase:

- **Email address** (used for login and identification)  
- **Display name** and **profile photo** (if available via Google)  
- **Authentication metadata** such as sign-in timestamps and method  

Atomatic does **not** collect additional personal data beyond what is required for authentication.

---

## Data Retention
- Your data (email address, display name, profile photo) is stored securely in **Firebase Authentication**.  
- The data is retained **as long as your account remains active**.  
- If you stop using the app but do not request account deletion, your authentication data may remain stored for security and account recovery purposes.  
- Atomatic does **not** store your password — all authentication is securely handled by Firebase.

---

## Requesting Account Deletion
Users may request the **deletion of their Atomatic account** and associated data at any time.

To request account deletion:

1. Send an email to **atomatic@deekshith.in** with the subject line:  
   **"Account Deletion Request – Atomatic App"**

2. Include the following details in your message:
   - The **email address** you used to sign in to Atomatic  
   - A short statement confirming that you want your account permanently deleted  

3. Once we receive your request:
   - We will verify your identity using the provided email.  
   - After verification, your account and all associated data will be **permanently deleted from Firebase**.  
   - You will receive a confirmation email once deletion is complete.

---

## Data Security
- All communication with Firebase is **encrypted (HTTPS)**.  
- Access to user data is limited to **authorized developers only**.  
- User data is **never sold or shared** with third parties for marketing or advertising.

## Changes to This Policy
This Data Retention and Deletion Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in features or legal requirements.  
The latest version will always be available in the app’s documentation or Play Store listing.
