# Privacy Policy — Atomatic Android App

## Introduction
Atomatic respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and your rights regarding that data.

---

## Data Collection and Use
Atomatic does not automatically collect any personally identifiable information without the explicit consent of the user.

As of this version, Atomatic allows users to **sign in using their Google account** or **create an account with a username and password**.  
Authentication is managed using **Firebase Authentication**, a service provided by **Google LLC**.

When you sign in, Firebase may collect and process the following data:

- **Email address** (required for login and identification)  
- **Display name** and **profile photo** (if available via Google)  
- **Authentication metadata** such as sign-in method or timestamps  

Atomatic’s developers have access to users’ **email addresses** through Firebase for:
- Account management and identification  
- Providing technical support or user assistance  
- Maintaining security and preventing unauthorized access  

Atomatic does **not** sell, rent, or share user email addresses with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

## Third-Party Services
Atomatic uses the following third-party services, which may collect data according to their own privacy policies:

1. **Firebase Authentication (by Google LLC)** — for user authentication and account management.  
   [Firebase Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

2. **GitHub (github.com)** — for checking app updates and related information.  
   [GitHub Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement)

---

## Data Retention and Security
- Atomatic does **not** store user passwords; all authentication is securely handled by Firebase.  
- User email addresses may be stored in Firebase for as long as the account remains active.  
- All data is transmitted over **encrypted (HTTPS)** connections.  
- Access to user data is restricted to **authorized developers only** and used solely for operational and support purposes.

---

## User Consent
By signing in using Firebase Authentication (Google or email/password), you consent to:
- The collection and processing of your data as described above.  
- The handling of your information according to Firebase’s and Atomatic’s privacy practices.

If you do not wish to share this information, you may use Atomatic without signing in, though certain features may be unavailable.

---

## Children’s Privacy
Atomatic is not directed at children under the age of 13. The app does not knowingly collect personal data from children.  
If you believe a child has provided such information, please contact the developer to have it deleted.

---

## Changes to This Policy
This privacy policy may be updated in the future to reflect new features or compliance requirements.  
The developer will make reasonable efforts to comply with **Google Play Store** and other applicable policies.

_Last updated: October 2025_
