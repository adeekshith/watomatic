### ‚ù§Ô∏è Your Privacy Matters

Atomatic doesn‚Äôt connect to the internet and doesn‚Äôt send your data anywhere. All processing is done locally on your device. We believe privacy isn‚Äôt a feature‚Äîit‚Äôs a right.

### üéØ Perfect For:

*   Driving or commuting
*   Working without distractions
*   Studying or attending meetings
*   Taking personal time or going on vacation

### ‚ú® Loved by Many

Atomatic is trusted by many users around the world (was previously launched with a different name) to help them stay present in real life while remaining courteous in digital conversations. Simple to set up, easy to forget‚Äîit just works.

### üöÄ Get Started in Seconds

1.  Install Atomatic
2.  Enable notification access
3.  Set your auto-reply message
4.  Relax and let Automatic handle the rest.

This app is not associated with any company including WhatsApp, Facebook, Signal.

### Troubleshooting

- Auto reply does not work even after Atomatic is enabled
  
  Atomatic relies on notifications for auto reply to work. Most users usually have notifications enabled so should work straight out of the box but otherwise please make sure notifications permissions are enabled and fingerprint lock is disabled for this app to work.

### FAQ

- Why not use WhatsApp business account for auto replies?
  
  You cannot use business account without accepting the new privacy policy that everyone is trying to avoid.

- Will this be available for iOS in the future
  
  This app relies on Android specific notification quick replies feature to function. I am not aware of similar functionality on iOS but will look into it.
